## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
-Optimize the project for loading speed by compressing images (if applicable).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

1. Learned how to add overlay to a background and style it in css:

```html
<div class="overlay"></div>
```
```css
.hero .overlay {
    position: absolute;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
```
Alternatively can add an overlay using linear-gradient 
```css
.furniture{
    background: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
}
```
2. Feather icons - learning the different type of feather icons and how to use the has been a game changer.

```js
<script>
        feather.replace();
 </script>
```
3. CSS Grid -  this is very hepful with responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [How TO - Overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_overlay.asp)- This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Overlays. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
